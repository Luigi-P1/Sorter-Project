# Sorter-Project
This is the project looking at several sorting algorithms;

These algorithms are:

-Bubble sort

-Merge sort

-Quick sort

-Insertion sort

-Selection sort

The project will allow the user choose a range of the algorithms. 
Then the user can specify the length of the array used (the array will be composed of ints between 0 and 100).
The project will then show the user the unsorted and sorted arrays, which method was used and how long the sort took.

INPUT:

-length of array

-which sorting algorithms to use

OUTPUT:

-Unsorted array

-Sorted array

-The algorithm used

-How long the algorithm took to sort the array

The application will also log which algorithms are used and 
if an invalid choice of algorithm was given.
If you want to run the application; run the main class.
